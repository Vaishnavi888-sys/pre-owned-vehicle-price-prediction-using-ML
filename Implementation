IMPLEMENTATION:
The algorithms which are used in implementing this model are Linear Regression and Random Forest.
a) LINEAR REGRESSION:
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to
observed data. The goal is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the difference betweenactual and predicted values. 
• Working of Linear Regression:
Linear regression works by establishing a linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. The algorithm aims to find the best-fit line through the data
points by determining the optimal slope and intercept, typically using the method of least squares. This involves minimizing the sum of squared differences between the predicted
and actual values. Once trained, the model can predict new outcomes by applying the learned coefficients to new input data, making it a fundamental tool in statistical modeling
and prediction. 

b)STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Import libraries
• Import necessary python libraries. 
• The required python libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.

2. Load and Preprocess data
• Load the dataset. 
• Handle the missing values to make the data clean and converting categorical variables into numerical variables to make the system understand the data.

3. Train Test Split :
• Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Model Training :
In the model training the linear regression model and random forest model are trained with training set data. 

5. Model Evaluation:
• Evaluate models on the test set by calculating the R2 score and the accuracy score for both model is obtained.

6. Web Application:
• Create the website
• That is integrate the best machine learning model to the flask and then run theflask application.

MODULES DESCRIPTION:
1) Data collection and preprocessing
2) Model development and training
3) Model deployment and prediction

Data Collection and Preprocessing Module: 
This module is responsible for gathering data from various sources, such as online car listings, dealerships, and automotive databases. 
The data includes features like car make, model, year, mileage, condition, location, and more. 
The preprocessing steps involve cleaning thedata(handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates), feature engineering (e.g., extractingthecar's age from the year), and encoding categorical variables.
The cleaned and processeddataset will be used for model training and evaluation.

Model Development and Training Module:
In this module, various machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict the priceofpre-owned cars. Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForests, andGradient Boosting are explored.
The module includes splitting the dataset into trainingandtesting sets, selecting features, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy. Thetrained model will then be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine its performance.

Model Deployment and Prediction Module:
This module focuses on deploying the trained model to a production environment, allowingusers to input car details and receive price predictions. It involves creating a user-friendlyinterface (e.g., a web app or API) where users can input the car's features andget anestimated price.
The module also includes monitoring the model's performance over time, updating it with new data, and retraining as necessary to maintain accuracy
